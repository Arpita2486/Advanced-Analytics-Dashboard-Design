#  Advanced Analytics & Dashboard Design â€“ Achievement 6

**Project Title:** Interactive Analysis & Visualization with Python and Tableau  
**Role:** Data Analyst  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Tableau Public

##  Project Summary

This project focuses on performing advanced exploratory and statistical analysis on a real-world dataset, and presenting key findings through an interactive dashboard. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights through supervised and unsupervised learning, geospatial analysis, and time series forecastingâ€”then visualize those insights for stakeholders using Tableau.

##  Objectives

- Opensource dataset used: World University Rankings
- Perform the following types of analysis:
  - Exploratory data visualization
  - Regression modeling
  - Clustering analysis
  - Time series forecasting
  - Geospatial visualization

- Build an **interactive Tableau dashboard** to summarize findings.
- Document all Python analysis and code on GitHub.

##  Research Questions

- What patterns or trends exist in the dataset?
- Are there geographic differences in behavior or outcomes?
- Can variables predict a target outcome using regression?
- Are there natural clusters in the data?
- What does the time-based behavior look like?

##  Analyses Conducted

- **Exploratory Analysis:** Correlation heatmaps, pairplots, histograms, and categorical plots.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Choropleth map using shapefile + Python (GeoPandas or Plotly).
- **Regression Analysis:** Linear regression with train/test split, evaluation metrics (RÂ², RMSE).
- **Cluster Analysis:** K-means clustering with Elbow Method; visualized clusters and descriptive summaries.
- **Time Series Forecasting:** Decomposition, Dickey-Fuller test, differencing for stationarity, ACF/PACF plots.

##  Tableau Dashboard

An interactive Tableau dashboard was created to summarize the curated results from the analyses and communicate insights effectively to stakeholders.
